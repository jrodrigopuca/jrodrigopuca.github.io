            </h2>
            <div class="card-text">
                Like I mentioned before, this audiobook is just $1.99. The only reason I'm doing this, is because I know you're going to love the content and naturally want more products from my company, or to even have us run the advertising for you.
                Oh, and in case you're wondering...

                There's NO hidden "continuity program" - and in case you're wondering why I'm doing this...
                Well, there are actually a few reasons...
            </div>
            <ol class="card-items">
                <li class="card-item">
                    1. It allows me to get my message out and help a ton of business owners. $1.99 is nothing, and I know the information can change your business forever.

                <li class="card-item">
                    2. I know when I share my best stuff you're going to want to get more from me, whether that's 1 on 1 consulting or even having my team run your ads for your business.
                </li>
                <li class="card-item">
                    3. I'm kinda a show off... I'm not going to lie. I'm sick of people throwing out conversion numbers and their stats without any real proof to back it up. I think 99% of what is said online is complete BS... so I thought it would be a breath of fresh air to publish the TRUE, show the actual stats and #'s behind what we do, and well... honestly, I just want you to think I'm cool. :)

                    These audiobooks fly off the shelves, most days we do anywhere from 25 - 50 audiobook sales a day, that means that a ton of people reach out for our services, when we hit our max capacity for clients, we have to shut down this page until we have enough new trained employees for our next batch of clients. So this page will be coming down when we hit our capacity again.
